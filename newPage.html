      <h1 class="center1">How Tourism Helps a Country's Economy</h1>

      <h2>Revenue Generation</h2>
      <p>Tourism brings in foreign exchange through spending by international tourists on accommodation, transportation, food, souvenirs, and other goods and services. This influx of foreign currency boosts the country's revenue and can contribute significantly to its GDP.</p>
    
      <h2>Job Creation</h2>
      <p>The tourism industry generates employment opportunities across various sectors such as hospitality, transportation, entertainment, and retail. From hotel staff and tour guides to artisans and taxi drivers, tourism creates a diverse range of jobs, thereby reducing unemployment rates and improving living standards.</p>
    
      <h2>Infrastructure Development</h2>
      <p>To accommodate tourists, countries often invest in infrastructure development projects such as airports, roads, hotels, restaurants, and recreational facilities. These developments not only enhance the overall tourism experience but also contribute to the country's long-term economic growth and competitiveness.</p>
    
      <h2>Stimulating Other Industries</h2>
      <p>The demand generated by tourism has a multiplier effect on other sectors of the economy. For example, increased tourism may lead to higher demand for agricultural products, handicrafts, cultural performances, and transportation services, benefiting local producers and businesses.</p>
    
      <h2>Cultural Exchange and Diplomacy</h2>
      <p>Tourism fosters cultural exchange and understanding between nations, promoting peace and cooperation. By showcasing their heritage, traditions, and natural attractions, countries can attract visitors and build positive perceptions, ultimately strengthening diplomatic ties and international relations.</p>
